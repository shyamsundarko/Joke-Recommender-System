# Joke-Recommender-System
Two recommendation systems have been built:
1) A simple recommendation system:\ 
    - This is built using the Pearson's correllation coeffecient\ 
    - Jokes recommended are from the same dataset
2) A more complex recommendation system using collaborative filtering\ 
    - This is built using collaborative filtering\ 
    - Jokes recommended from another dataset based on user choices on a different initial dataset



The following are included:
1) A jupyter notebook file of type .ipynb containing cleaning of the datasets and building of the recommender system
2) Three excel files containing joke ratings(by several thousand users) for 100 jokes 
3) A folder containing links to all the 100 jokes
4) A powerpoint presentation with a detailed description of the project
